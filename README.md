Advent of Code - 2021
=====================

My third iteration of '[Advent of Code][AoC]'. The year is [2021].

Because the creator of AoC is still? [a bit sad][phpsadness], I decided to give the latest,
just released version of [PHP] a try. (8.1, now with long awaited enums, hooray!)


Disclaimer
----------

The code you may find here will probably suck. Chosen solutions are whatever popped into my head first,
and only optimized (for execution speed) when really needed. Easy and fast to code had preference over elegant, robust
and easy to maintain.

My work here does not represent what I would create in a professional setting.
